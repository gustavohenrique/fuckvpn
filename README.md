### Installing CA Certificate in Firefox

To enable HTTPS proxying using FuckVPN, the client machine needs to trust the proxy's SSL certificate. 
Here's how to install the CA certificate in Firefox:

1. Generate a CA certificate or use the `certs/ca.pem`
2. Install the CA Certificate in Firefox:
- Open Firefox.
- Click the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner and go to Settings.
- Scroll down to the Privacy & Security section.
- Under the Certificates section, click View Certificates.
- In the Authorities tab, click Import.
- Select the ca_cert.pem file you generated or provided by FuckVPN.
- After selecting the file, ensure the option Trust this CA to identify websites is checked.
- Click OK to complete the process.
- Now Firefox will trust the proxyâ€™s CA certificate, allowing you to proxy HTTPS traffic without security warnings.

### Usage

```sh
./fuckvpn -cert certs/ca.pem -key certs/ca.key -addr :8080 -v
```
